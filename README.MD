#Chrome Unlocker
Chrome unlocker is a tool aim to unblock restrictions applied by your IT administrations, such as no extension allowed.

This tool also provides a simple shortcut for you to sync your profile to your shared network drive, so you don't have to keep backup/restore your profiles containing all config and extensions. But do keep in mind that shared drive are not fast as your C-Drive.

.Net 4.5 required, but I guess you can turn that a bit down and then compile it; Some of the source code are taken from Internet(SO), I have left the link to the post  where I found them.
